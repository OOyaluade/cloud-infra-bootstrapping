# üè• Cloud Infra Bootstrapping for Healthcare Startup

This repo sets up secure AWS cloud infrastructure for a healthcare-focused SaaS product.
We will build everything using Terraform ‚Äî from IAM to EKS to ML model deployment.

## üîê Day 1: AWS CLI & IAM Setup

To deploy AWS infrastructure with Terraform, I began by:
- Configuring the AWS CLI using least-privilege IAM credentials
- Targeting `us-east-1` as my default region
- Verifying CLI access via `aws sts get-caller-identity`

> üìÅ See `docs/aws-cli-setup.md` for full config steps
