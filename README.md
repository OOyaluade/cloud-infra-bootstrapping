# üìå AWS CLI & IAM Setup
*| This Project is evolving until launch in ~6 months(November,2025). Early contributors are welcome |*
# üè• Cloud Infra Bootstrapping for Startup in:

- Healthcare
- MLE / DS
- E.T.C
This project bootstraps a **production-ready cloud platform** designed for **healthcare SaaS applications, machine learning workflows, and enterprise observability with tooling to allow experts to customize later ‚Äî without blocking early progress.**

Originally built for the fictional company **CareMesh Health**, this platform simulates real-world AWS cloud infrastructure needs for fast-growing SaaS and ML-driven healthcare companies.

## ü©º Linting & Commit Standards Setup

To enforce consistent formatting and commit hygiene across Terraform, Markdown, YAML, and Git messages, this project includes a setup script:

```bash
chmod +x .githooks/commit-msgs
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

```

---

## üß† Enterprise Scenario: *CareMesh Health*

**CareMesh Health** is expanding from a monolithic, single-account AWS setup into a secure multi-account, multi-region architecture.
Their product suite includes telehealth apps, predictive analytics tools, and AI-powered services ‚Äî all of which must run on scalable, compliant infrastructure.

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Core Business Needs:

* HIPAA-compliant data storage & processing
* CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment of patient-facing web apps and ML services
* A scalable architecture to support predictive analytics (e.g., patient no-shows, risk scoring)
* Team-based access separation: Dev, ML, Security, Compliance, and Production
* Cost transparency and control across business units

### üåê Cloud Infrastructure Goals:

1. **Multi-Account AWS Org** to isolate environments
2. **Terraform Modules** for repeatable networking and services
3. **EKS for App & ML Workloads** with GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. **Centralized Logging & Monitoring** for operations and incident response
5. **S3 + RDS + DynamoDB** as core data services
6. **MLflow + FastAPI + Prometheus/Grafana** stack for machine learning operations
7. **KMS, IAM SCPs, and GuardDuty** for security

### *CareMesh Health* Progress & Roadmap

> \[Note!!!] : While you are programatically able to create new AWS accounts using Terraform, programatic deletion like `terraform destroy ` will fail to remove both new and existing account. Ensure that before you apply, you/team members have access to the email addresse/s for the account/s you plan to create.

> \[Note!!!] : **AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)** must be manually activated in each AWS Organization's management account. Terraform **cannot** enable Identity Center automatically, just like it cannot delete AWS accounts. You must first log in via console, activate Identity Center, and configure your identity source (built-in, Active Directory, or external IdP). Only then can Terraform manage permission sets and assignments.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Terraform requires that the **S3 bucket** (for storing the state file) and the **DynamoDB table** (for state locking) already exist before initializing the backend.
> Terraform also does not need DynamoDB to be configured in its new update. You only need to set an existing S3 to `use_lockfile` to `true`. Don't worry, i have added this revised method to the `terraform.tf` file. Just create the bucket that will manage your state file manually or use the CLI script below.

---

#### ‚úÖ Solution: Manual or Bootstrap Step

Before you can deploy the rest of the infrastructure (`01_cloudinfra`), you must **manually create** or **bootstrap** the following resources:

| Resource       | Example Name        | Purpose                               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| S3 Bucket      | `caremesh-tf-2723`  | Store Terraform state                 |

```bash
# Create S3 bucket
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket caremesh-tf-2723 --region us-east-1
```


> üíº **In real enterprise environments**, many teams use [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud) or tools like Spacelift or Atlantis for easier collaboration, secure state handling, and CI/CD workflows.

| **Dev**        | All non-prod resources & testing                  |
| **MLE / DS**   | Model training, evaluation, critical ML workloads |
| **Prod**       | Production systems, regulated and external-facing |
